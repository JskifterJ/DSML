# Electric Vehicles and Air Quality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the impact of electric vehicle (EV) adoption on air quality, focusing primarily on Switzerland. Through data analysis and statistical evaluation, we aim to determine whether there is measurable evidence supporting the claim that EVs significantly improve air quality.

## Objectives
- Collect and analyze historical data on EV sales and air quality metrics.
- Perform trend analysis to examine the relationship between EV adoption and air quality indicators (e.g., PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ, CO‚ÇÇ).
- Use statistical and machine learning techniques to evaluate the significance of observed changes.
- Present findings through a Streamlit app and visualizations.

| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Distribution of PHEVs by Country** | Nordic countries (NO, SE) show broader adoption and higher PHEV shares than CH and LX.   |
| **BEV Trends Over Time**             | Norway shows exponential BEV growth post-2016; other countries follow gradually.         |
| **AFV Market Share**                 | Norway again leads in both central tendency and spread; CH and AT are more conservative. |
| **New AFV Registrations by Country** | Norway and Netherlands show the highest volume and variance‚Äîreflecting policy impact.    |
| **AFV Registrations Over Time**      | Steep uptick across all countries since 2018, especially in NL, NO, and SE.              |

Norway consistently leads in BEV and PHEV integration. Recent growth across countries supports the hypothesis that AFV adoption has accelerated post-2018 due to policy and infrastructure improvements.

| **Annual Trends by Country**                    | NO‚ÇÇ/NO‚Çì declines are consistent; PM10 is noisier due to non-exhaust factors.        |
| **Hourly Pollution Patterns (All Countries)**   | Strong diurnal patterns‚Äîspikes during rush hours. CO‚ÇÇ and NO‚ÇÇ align with traffic.   |
| **Hourly Patterns by Country**                  | Norway/Sweden show flatter curves and lower peak values; others show AM/PM surges.  |
| **Air Quality Station Density**                 | AT and SE have most stations; CH has fewer, which may limit spatial granularity.    |

Local pollutants from combustion (NO‚Çì, NO‚ÇÇ) are decreasing, aligned with EV adoption and stricter emissions standards. PMs show more erratic behavior, reinforcing the importance of considering non-exhaust sources.

## üîç Model Setup & Main Takeways




This project examines only **local air quality** and not **global emissions** in the context of increasing electric and alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) adoption across six European countries. To better understand the results and context, here is a quick primer on regional vs. global impact of a changing passenger-vehicle fleet from internal-combustion to alternative fuels (PHEV, BEV etc.)

### üîÅ Regional Impact (Urban Air Quality)

\[
\text{Regional Impact} =
E^{\text{ICE}}_{\text{tailpipe}} +
E^{\text{non-exhaust}}_{\text{ICE}} -
\Delta E^{\text{EV}}_{\text{tailpipe}} -
\Delta E^{\text{EV}}_{\text{brake}} +
\Delta E^{\text{EV}}_{\text{tire}}
\]

- Tailpipe pollutants (CO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÇ, PM) are eliminated by EVs.
- Regenerative braking reduces brake dust, a major PM source.
- Heavier EVs increase tire and road particulate matter emissions.

> üìå Urban residents benefit most from tailpipe reductions, but gains can be offset by non-exhaust PM‚Äîespecially in cities.

### üåç Global Impact (Lifecycle Emissions)

\[
\text{Global Impact} =
E^{\text{fossil}}_{\text{extraction}} +
E^{\text{EV}}_{\text{battery}} +
E^{\text{grid}}_{\text{operation}} -
\Delta E^{\text{ICE}}_{\text{tailpipe, lifetime}}
\]

- Includes emissions from fossil fuel production and battery manufacturing.
- Depends heavily on the national electricity mix used for charging.
- EVs displace ICE vehicles, avoiding long-term tailpipe CO‚ÇÇ.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è An EV powered by renewables is far cleaner than one powered by coal. Lifecycle analysis is key for climate policy, addressing all upstream (fuel extraction, processing etc., vehicle components (rare earths) etc.).

These formulas frame the limitations of our regression models and data interpretations, since the objective and scope of this study is to evaluate regional patterns observing only fleet-% of alternative (read primarily BEV) vehicles across six high-penetration EU countries: DK, SE, NO, AT, CH and NL.






Analysis:


Notes: 
- while one could run the models based on transport-specific data, this data is merely a proxy for the average fuel consumption per kilometer of the transport fleet. With increasing adoption of Alternative Fuels (AF) vehicles in the fleet, this number will obviously be directled correlated with the change in emission factors such as CO2 and NO. Further, this would neglect the emissions of electricity production mix which BEV and PHEV vehicles require, thus severely graying the true picture of regional emission-data corresponding to passenger car emissions. 
- we chose to include PM factors due to the how most BEV and PHEV vehicles brake exclusively with regenerative braking which thus produces less brake dust. On the other hand, the heavy nature of especially BEV's due to battery weight may cause increased dispersion of tire particulate matter. It is important to realize these considerations when interpreting results.

2. Handling Negative and Outlier Values in Air Quality Data
Air quality measurement devices, especially those used for pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, NO, and CO2, are inherently noisy‚Äîparticularly at low concentrations. This noise, combined with instrument calibration drift, baseline corrections, and data averaging, can result in negative values or extreme outliers in the recorded data. Negative concentrations are not physically meaningful and are artifacts of the measurement process.

To ensure robust analysis:

Negative values are set to zero, as they do not represent real-world pollutant concentrations.
Outliers are detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method and are replaced with NaN values. This helps prevent extreme, likely erroneous values from skewing statistical analyses and visualizations.
This cleaning step is essential for producing reliable insights from environmental monitoring data and is a standard practice in air quality data science.


3. Cleaning
Raw Data Aggregation
Multiple CSVs from different sampling points were merged into a single DataFrame.
Country codes were extracted from sampling point IDs and added as a new column.
Initial Cleaning
Unnecessary columns (e.g., ResultTime, DataCapture, FkObservationLog, Validity, Verification) were dropped.
Pollutant codes were mapped to human-readable names (e.g., 7 to CO2, 8 to NO2, etc.).
Datetime columns were converted to pandas datetime objects, and rows with invalid dates were dropped.
Data Correction
Negative values (measurement errors, common in air quality data) were set to zero, as they are not physically meaningful.
Entries before 2012 and for 2024 were removed due to data quality or incompleteness.
Outlier Handling
Outliers were detected for each pollutant using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
Outlier values were replaced with NaN to avoid skewing averages.
Feature Engineering
Date and hour were extracted from the datetime column.
Year was extracted for annual aggregation.
Weekday/weekend flags were created using the .dt.weekday property.
Averaging and Aggregation
Daily averages were computed for each country, pollutant, and date.
Daytime (9:00‚Äì18:00) and rush-hour (8:00‚Äì10:00 & 15:00‚Äì18:00) periods were defined using the hour column.
For each period (full week, weekdays, weekends), annual averages were calculated for both daytime and rush-hour windows.
Final Output
The resulting annual averages were pivoted to a wide format, with columns for each period and time window.
The cleaned, aggregated data was saved as AQ_annual_averages.csv for use in regression analysis.


4. Analysis
Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning
Step Description:

For each pollutant and each annual average air quality metric, we fit several regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) to predict air quality from fleet share and country fixed effects.
For Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest, we use an extensive grid search (GridSearchCV) to tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing model for each pollutant/target combination.
We report both train and test R¬≤, as well as the overfit gap, to assess model generalization and avoid overfitting.
The best and worst models for each pollutant/target are saved for further analysis and visualization in the Streamlit app.
Rationale for Hyperparameter Choices:

Small dataset (50‚Äì60 samples):
We use a broad but not excessive grid to balance thoroughness and computational feasibility.
Ridge/Lasso:
alpha is searched on a log scale from very small (1e-4) to large (1e2 or 1e3) values to capture both weak and strong regularization.
Both fit_intercept options are tested to allow for models with or without intercept.
For Lasso, both cyclic and random coordinate descent strategies are included.
For Ridge, multiple solvers are tested for robustness.
Random Forest:
n_estimators (number of trees) is varied from 50 to 500 for flexibility.
max_depth is varied from shallow to deep (including unlimited) to control model complexity.
min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf are varied to test different minimum data requirements for splits and leaves, helping to avoid overfitting.
max_features is varied to test different feature selection strategies at each split.
