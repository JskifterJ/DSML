# Electric Vehicles and Air Quality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the impact of electric vehicle (EV) adoption on air quality, focusing primarily on Switzerland. Through data analysis and statistical evaluation, we aim to determine whether there is measurable evidence supporting the claim that EVs significantly improve air quality.

## Objectives
- Collect and analyze historical data on EV sales and air quality metrics.
- Perform trend analysis to examine the relationship between EV adoption and air quality indicators (e.g., PM2.5, NOâ‚‚, COâ‚‚).
- Use statistical and machine learning techniques to evaluate the significance of observed changes.
- Present findings through a Streamlit app and visualizations.
