    Welcome to the **Electric Vehicle (EV) Impact Dashboard**! üå±üöó  
    In recent years, the adoption of electric vehicles has been heralded as a game-changer in the fight against climate change and air pollution. But how much of an impact are EVs actually having on the air we breathe?  
    This dashboard dives into the data to explore whether the promises of cleaner air and reduced emissions are being realized.

    st.write("""
    Electric vehicles (EVs) have been promoted as a sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. By replacing gasoline and diesel with electricity, EVs aim to:
    - **Reduce greenhouse gas emissions**: EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, helping to combat climate change.
    - **Improve urban air quality**: Cities plagued by smog and particulate matter stand to benefit from reduced vehicle emissions.
    - **Lower dependency on fossil fuels**: Transitioning to EVs aligns with global efforts to shift toward renewable energy sources.

    However, the environmental benefits of EVs depend on several factors:
    - The **energy mix** used to generate electricity (e.g., coal vs. renewables).
    - The **lifecycle emissions** of EVs, including manufacturing and battery disposal.
    - The **rate of adoption** and replacement of ICE vehicles.
    """)

    Air pollution is a major public health concern, contributing to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and premature deaths. Key pollutants include:
    - **PM2.5**: Fine particulate matter that penetrates deep into the lungs.
    - **NO‚ÇÇ**: Nitrogen dioxide, primarily emitted by vehicles and industrial processes.
    - **CO‚ÇÇ**: Carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.

    The adoption of EVs is expected to reduce these pollutants, especially in urban areas. But is this happening at the scale we hoped for? This dashboard explores:
    - Trends in EV adoption across countries.
    - Changes in air quality metrics over time.
    - The relationship between EV adoption and air quality improvements.

    - **Air Quality Predictor**: Predict air quality metrics based on EV adoption levels.
    - **Literature Review**: Explore existing research on EVs and their environmental impact.
