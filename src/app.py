    These studies highlight the complexity of assessing the environmental benefits of EV adoption. While there are clear benefits in reducing road-level emissions, the overall impact depends on factors such as:
    - The energy mix used for electricity generation.
    - Lifecycle emissions of EVs, including manufacturing and disposal.
    - Regional differences in air quality and EV adoption rates.

    Our analysis builds on these findings by focusing on specific countries (e.g., Switzerland, Norway) and examining the relationship between EV adoption and air quality metrics over time.
