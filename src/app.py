    Welcome to the **Electric Vehicle (EV) Impact Dashboard**! üå±üöó  
    In recent years, the adoption of electric vehicles has been heralded as a game-changer in the fight against climate change and air pollution. But how much of an impact are EVs actually having on the air we breathe?  
    This dashboard dives into the data to explore whether the promises of cleaner air and reduced emissions are being realized.

    Electric vehicles (EVs) have been promoted as a sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. By replacing gasoline and diesel with electricity, EVs aim to:
    - **Reduce greenhouse gas emissions**: EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, helping to combat climate change.
    - **Improve urban air quality**: Cities plagued by smog and particulate matter stand to benefit from reduced vehicle emissions.
    - **Lower dependency on fossil fuels**: Transitioning to EVs aligns with global efforts to shift toward renewable energy sources.

    However, the environmental benefits of EVs depend on several factors:
    - The **energy mix** used to generate electricity (e.g., coal vs. renewables).
    - The **lifecycle emissions** of EVs, including manufacturing and battery disposal.
    - The **rate of adoption** and replacement of ICE vehicles.

    - **CO‚ÇÇ**: Carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.

    The adoption of EVs is expected to reduce these pollutants, especially in urban areas. But is this happening at the scale we hoped for? This dashboard explores:

    """)

    st.write("""
    ## Key Findings
    - Our analysis explored the relationship between electric vehicle (EV) adoption and air quality across Europe using a variety of statistical and machine learning models.
    - We found that in some countries and for some pollutants, EV adoption is associated with measurable improvements in air quality, but the relationship is complex and varies by context.
    - The top-performing models (see tables below) show strong predictive power for certain pollutant-country combinations, while others remain challenging to model.

    ## Methodology: How Did We Find the Best Models?
    - We compared several regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) for each pollutant and air quality metric.
    - Models were evaluated using the R¬≤ score, which measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.
    - The "best" model for each pollutant/target combination is the one with the highest R¬≤ on the test set.
    - Statistical significance is indicated with stars (*, **, ***), where available, based on conventional p-value thresholds:
        - *p* < 0.05 (*), *p* < 0.01 (**), *p* < 0.001 (***)
    - Note: Not all machine learning models provide p-values; stars are shown only where applicable (typically for linear models).

    **Choosing and Interpreting Air Quality Data is Tricky!**

    - **Negative values in air quality data** are common due to sensor noise, especially at low concentrations. These are not physically meaningful and are set to zero during cleaning. ([EPA Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/air-sensor-toolbox/air-sensor-performance-targets-and-testing-protocols))
    - **PM2.5 and PM10** are not just from tailpipes! While EVs reduce exhaust, heavier EVs can increase tire and road dust, and regenerative braking reduces brake dust. ([ICCT Report](https://theicct.org/publication/non-exhaust-pm-emissions-from-electric-vehicles-mar2020/))
    - **CO‚ÇÇ and NO‚ÇÇ** are affected by much more than cars: energy production mix, industrial activity, and even weather patterns play a huge role. For example, Switzerland‚Äôs clean grid means EVs are ‚Äúgreener‚Äù there than in coal-heavy countries.
    - **Causality is hard:** Even if we see a correlation between EV adoption and cleaner air, it doesn‚Äôt prove EVs are the cause. Factors like improved public transport, stricter emissions standards, or economic changes can all confound the results.
    - **Data cleaning matters:** Outliers and negative values are handled carefully to avoid misleading results. See the README for details on our robust cleaning pipeline!
